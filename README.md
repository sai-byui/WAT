# WAT
Words Are Things Project --
The goal of this project is to create a translation machine that...
1. Can take near-english sentences and turn them into python code.
2. Can learn new words.
3. After we implement the first two, make it work by providing near-english pseudocode to generate code that runs a simple chess game.

The project is written in Python, a language which all of us are learning with this project, but seems to be a good choice for this project.

# Running the project

"python run.py" to run project
"python pdb_run.py" to run in the python debugger (pdb)
